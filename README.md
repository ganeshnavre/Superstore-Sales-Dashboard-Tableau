#  Superstore Sales Dashboard 
 Project Overview

The Superstore Sales Dashboard is my attempt to bring the well-known Superstore dataset to life. Instead of static charts, I wanted to design an interactive, business-ready dashboard that not only looks clean but also tells a story. The dashboard uncovers whatâ€™s driving sales, where profits are leaking, and how customer behavior impacts performance.

 Objectives

Turn raw Superstore data into actionable insights.

Highlight sales, profit, discount patterns, and customer contributions.

Create a dashboard that decision-makers can use to spot growth opportunities and fix weak areas quickly.

ðŸ›  Tools & Dataset

Tableau Public â†’ Data visualization & storytelling.

Superstore Dataset â†’ Classic sample dataset with Orders, Sales, Profit, and Customer details.

 Key Features

 KPI Cards â†’ Sales, Profit, Quantity, and Discount at a glance.
 Regional Map â†’ See which regions drive revenue and which lag behind.
 Category & Sub-Category Insights â†’ Identify profitable and loss-making segments.
 Trend Analysis â†’ Monthly sales & profit to reveal seasonality.
 Customer Analysis â†’ Top customers contributing to revenue.

 Insights from the Dashboard

Technology is the most profitable category, while Furniture underperforms.

West Region generates high sales but suffers from heavy discounts.

A handful of loyal customers contribute a significant share of revenue.

Strong seasonal peaks appear in Novemberâ€“December, suggesting promotional opportunities.
