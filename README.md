# 📊 Superstore Sales Dashboard 
✨ Project Overview

The Superstore Sales Dashboard is my attempt to bring the well-known Superstore dataset to life. Instead of static charts, I wanted to design an interactive, business-ready dashboard that not only looks clean but also tells a story. The dashboard uncovers what’s driving sales, where profits are leaking, and how customer behavior impacts performance.

🎯 Objectives

Turn raw Superstore data into actionable insights.

Highlight sales, profit, discount patterns, and customer contributions.

Create a dashboard that decision-makers can use to spot growth opportunities and fix weak areas quickly.

🛠 Tools & Dataset

Tableau Public → Data visualization & storytelling.

Superstore Dataset → Classic sample dataset with Orders, Sales, Profit, and Customer details.

🔑 Key Features

✔️ KPI Cards → Sales, Profit, Quantity, and Discount at a glance.
✔️ Regional Map → See which regions drive revenue and which lag behind.
✔️ Category & Sub-Category Insights → Identify profitable and loss-making segments.
✔️ Trend Analysis → Monthly sales & profit to reveal seasonality.
✔️ Customer Analysis → Top customers contributing to revenue.

💡 Insights from the Dashboard

Technology is the most profitable category, while Furniture underperforms.

West Region generates high sales but suffers from heavy discounts.

A handful of loyal customers contribute a significant share of revenue.

Strong seasonal peaks appear in November–December, suggesting promotional opportunities.
